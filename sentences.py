    "She asked the question even though she didn't really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win "
    "situation since she already knew. If he told the truth, she'd get confirmation of her worst fears. "
    "If he lied, she'd know that he wasn't who she thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she "
    "asked the question anyway and waited for his answer.",
    "He hid under the covers hoping that nobody would notice him there. It really didn't make much sense "
    "since it would be obvious to anyone who walked into the room there was someone hiding there, but he "
    "still held out hope. He heard footsteps coming down the hall and stop in front in front of the "
    "bedroom door. He heard the squeak of the door hinges and someone opened the bedroom door. He held "
    "his breath waiting for whoever was about to discover him, but they never did.",
    "He swung back the fishing pole and cast the line which ell 25 feet away into the river. The lure "
    "landed in the perfect spot and he was sure he would soon get a bite. He never expected that the bite "
    "would come from behind in the form of a bear.",
    "There was no time. He ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work, but it didn't "
    "matter. He was late and if he didn't make this meeting on time, someone's life may be in danger.",
    "Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over "
    "Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it and taken it "
    "for an ordinary falling star. It seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.",
    "Stormi is a dog. She is dark grey and has long legs. Her eyes are expressive and are able to let her "
    "humans know what she is thinking. Her tongue is long, pink, and wet. Her long legs allow her to "
    "sprint after other dogs, people or bunnies. She can be a good dog, but also very bad. Her tail wags "
    "when happy or excited and hides between her back legs when she is bad. Stormi is a dog I love.",
    "The red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox. It had been the last to be played with and "
    "anticipated it would be the next as well. The other toys grumbled beneath. At one time each had held"
    " the spot of the red ball, but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box.",
    "It was a rat's nest. Not a literal one, but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning "
    "when she got up. It was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and "
    "tired of it. She peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it. It wasn't. She opened the "
    "drawer and picked up the hair clippers.",
    "After hunting for several hours, we finally saw a large seal sunning itself on a flat rock. I took "
    "one of the wooden clubs while Larry took the longer one. We slowly snuck up behind the seal until we "
    "were close enough to club it over its head. The seal slumped over and died. This seal would help us "
    "survive. We could eat the meat and fat. The fat could be burned in a shell for light and the fur "
    "could be used to make a blanket. We declared our first day of hunting a great success.",
    "The red glint of paint sparkled under the sun. He had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten, "
    "and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago. It was his baby and he spent hours caring "
    "for it, pampering it, and fondling over it. She knew this all too well, and that's exactly why she "
    "had taken a sludge hammer to it.",
    "Hopes and dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. "
    "The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could "
    "actually happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. "
    "That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.",
